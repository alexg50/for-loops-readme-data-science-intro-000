    "Programming is all about making things my dynamic and more efficient, right? Well a big part of making our code more efficient and dynamic are loops! They allow us to iterate over each element in a collection, like a list. Perhaps we could already do that by writing out a line of code for each element in the collection, but that wouldn't be very efficient, would it? No, not at all. With loops, we can write one line of code that operates on each element in a collection. Pretty cool, right? Let's get started!"
